# Starling

**Starling** is an agent-based simulation framework for urban mobility.

It provides generic classes to build transport models such as station-based sharing system,
public transport or shared taxis.

## Quickstart

This section will show you how to run the example simulation scenarios.

For a more detailed setup guide, see the section
[Running simulations](https://starling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run/running_simulations.html)
of the documentation.

### Installation

The *starling-sim* package is available on PiPy and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install starling-sim
```

You can check that the package was correctly installed by running the `starling-sim` command:

```bash
starling-sim --version
```

### Examples

If you need example scenarios, you can download the test scenarios from the repository.

If you cloned the Starling repository, you can also run the following command:

```bash
starling-sim data --examples
```

### Usage

Once the data is prepared, a scenario can be run from the project
root by running the `starling-sim` command with the path to the scenario folder. 
For instance:

```bash
starling-sim run data/models/SB_VS/example_nantes/
```

You will see the progression of the simulation with the logs that
appear in the console.

### Outputs

You can find the outputs of the scenario in the output folder.
In this case, its data/models/SB_VS/example_nantes/outputs/.

KPI files (.csv.gz) can be visualised with any spreadsheet software.

The visualisation file (.geojson) can be uploaded to the web application
[Kite](https://kite.tellae.fr/) to visualise the simulation run.

## Project status

[*Tellae*](https://tellae.fr/) is actively contributing to Starling as part of its research and development activities.

Tellae uses Starling in commercial contracts to study mobility projects. This is why
some of the models and algorithms developed around Starling are not shared in this repository.
