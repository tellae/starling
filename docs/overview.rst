Overview
********

Starling is a spatial, agent-based simulation framework
aimed towards transportation, especially urban mobility.

This project is developed as part of the R&D
of `Tellae <https://tellae.fr/>`_.


The goal of this framework is to provide a base for
the development of computer models for the simulation
of specific transport systems. It consists in generic
simulation classes that can be extended to fit the
specifications of the simulated system.

This framework is based on a generic agent-based model for the transport simulation.

The inputs and outputs formats are further described in :ref:`Inputs and outputs <inout>`

The framework comes along with :ref:`several simple
transportation models<models_introduction>`. New models can be built by extending these, or by
re-using some classes. Or from scratch.
