Overview
********

Starling is a spatial, agent-based simulation framework
aimed towards transportation and mobility.

The goal of this framework is to provide a base for
the development of computer models for the simulation
of specific transport systems. It consists in generic
simulation classes that can be extended to fit the
specifications of the simulated system.

Starling will allow you to :ref:`run simulations <running-simulations>`
of transport services with your own data.

The framework comes along with :ref:`several simple
transportation models<models_introduction>` that can be run with
example data or with your own scenarios.

If you want, you can :ref:`explore more in depth the processes of
Starling <understanding-starling>` and eventually
:ref:`develop your own simulation models <create-models>`.

For detailed documentation of the code, see the :ref:`api-ref`.
